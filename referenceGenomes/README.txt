This folder contains the reference genomes used for alignment for both ATAC-seq (Figure 1) and for mtFiber-seq PacBio alignment.

For ATAC-seq, one reference genome is included. This is the rCRS "chrM" sequence from Hg38:

	1) hg38_chrM.fa

For mtFiber-seq, three reference genomes are included based on how the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was linearized. These are derived from the rCRS from Hg38, with the first position of the genome shifted based on the method of linearization. The reference genomes included:

	1) hg38_chrM_BamHI.fa
		- This genome is used for alignments of all sequencing from HeLa 
		  mitochondria, which were linearized at the BamHI cut site.

	2) hg38_chrM_EagI.fa
		- This genome is used for alignments of all sequencing from Human Skeletal Muscle
		  Myoblasts, which were linearized at the EagI cut site
	
	3) hg38_chrM_lrpcr.fa
		- This genome is used for alignments of all sequencing from mtDNA generated by 
		  long-range PCR used for the in vitro reconstitution. The ends of the genome
   		  correspond to the ends of the primers used for PCR
